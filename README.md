# Learning-Go

I am no programmer.

I mainly work as a Google Workspace Administrator and other platforms. I am learning to program basic GO so it will help with my daily tasks. 

This first script I am creating is called aliasesCreator.go and it is mainly intended to create aliases for all existing users in a Google Workspace domain. There are specific Reasons why I have simply not used an Domain Alias and due to the # of users I want to have a script runing automatically for this creation. 

This is my first attempt and it is obviously a work in progress.
